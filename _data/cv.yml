    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
      year: 2023 - Present
      description:
        - Designed a pipeline to apply redshift corrections to DESI quasar observations, reducing dispersion by 30%.
        - Incorporated multiprocessing using JobLib and the NERSC High-Performance Computing cluster to visualize and analyze datasets as large as 200GB, delivering up to a 70x speedup on certain analysis tasks.
    - title: Undergraduate Research Fellow
      institution: Speech and Computation Lab at UC Berkeley
      year: 2022 - Present
      description:
        - Collaborated with researchers from Stanford, MIT, and JHU to deliver original work in leading NLP conferences.
        - Implemented spoken language models in PyTorch and prototyped architectural and performance improvements.
        - Developed portable applets in Google Colab to share results with other academics and in classroom settings.

    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: Multi Physics and Circuit Lab at San Jose State University
      year: 2021 - 2022
      description:
        - Designed deep learning tools for developing integrated circuits, extracting hidden device properties from empirically measured data and enabling inverse design based on desired device characteristics.
        - Combined variational autoencoders implemented in Tensorflow with shallow regression algorithms to approximate highly nonlinear semiconductor voltage transfer curves with R2 = 0.98 accuracy, at much lower computational cost.
