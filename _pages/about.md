Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Physics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I work with Prof. Gireeja Ranade on the LeanTutor project, a formally verified LLM math tutor using Lean4 that recently received a grant from the Renaissance Philanthropy AI for Math fund. I also work with Prof. Gasper Begus on deep learning for speech, with a focus on interpretability and unsupervised learning. Recently, I also collaborated with members of Prof. Dawn Song's group on mathematical conjecturing in a formal setting.

I'm broadly interested in building AI systems that learn and reason more like humans, whereas existing LLMs are limited by data reliance, creativity, and generalization. Recently, I've been thinking about the problems of how models can discover and reason using symbolic structure with minimal supervision, and developing self-improving agents that can generate, verify, and reuse abstractions over long horizons. I'm particularly interested in formally verified math, such as the Lean 4 language, as a domain over which we can realize these models.

Previously, I interned at Rivian as part of the Camera Systems team, worked with Dr. Alex Kim at LBNL on ML-based quasar analysis for the DESI collaboration, and was part of the Multi-Physics And Circuit (M-PAC) Lab at San Jose State University. 

I'm also part of [Combat Robotics at Berkeley](https://www.crberkeley.org/), a student organization that designs and builds Glitch, a 250-pound battlebot that competes on the [BattleBots TV Show](https://battlebots.com/) on Discovery and HBO Max! We've fought bots built by other university teams and professional engineers from around the world, and won Rookie of the Year on our debut, in World Championship VI.
