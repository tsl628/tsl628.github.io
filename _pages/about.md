I am a third-year undergraduate studying Physics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am part of the [Berkeley Speech and Computation Lab](https://twitter.com/BerkeleySCLab), and perform research under the supervision of [Prof. Gašper Beguš](https://gbegus.github.io/). Broadly speaking, my research focus is in deep learning for speech and computational linguistics, particularly with regards to developing more realistic and interpretable models of human speech. Recently, I also interned at Rivian Automotive, Inc, as part of the Camera Systems Team, where I primarily worked on developing software tools for automated image quality analysis.

I previously conducted research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where I was part of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, supervised by Dr. Alex Kim. I was also part of the Multi-Physics And Circuit (M-PAC) Lab at San Jose State University, where I developed VAE and GAN models to accelerate TCAD simulations.

I'm also part of [Combat Robotics at Berkeley](https://www.crberkeley.org/), a student organization that designs and builds Glitch, a 250-pound battlebot that competes on the [BattleBots TV Show](https://battlebots.com/) on Discovery and HBO Max! We've fought bots built by other university teams and professional engineers from around the world, and won Rookie of the Year on our debut, in World Championship VI.
