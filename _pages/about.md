I am a second-year undergraduate studying Physics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am part of the [Berkeley Speech and Computation Lab](https://twitter.com/BerkeleySCLab), and perform research under the supervision of [Prof. Gašper Beguš](https://gbegus.github.io/).

Broadly speaking, my interests are in deep learning for speech and computational linguistics, particularly with regards to interpretability, and in the applications of deep learning toward scientific computing. My current work involves studying the syntactical properties of GANs trained to synthesize human speech, both directly and indirectly through articulator models. I also work on projects to benchmark the capabilities of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Whisper.

Prior to joining the Speech and Computation Lab, I interned at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where I was part of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, supervised by Dr. Alex Kim. I was also part of the Multi-Physics And Circuit (M-PAC) Lab at San Jose State University, where I developed VAE and GAN models to accelerate TCAD simulations.

I'm also part of [Combat Robotics at Berkeley](https://www.crberkeley.org/), a student organization that designs and builds Glitch, a 250-pound battlebot that competes on the [BattleBots TV Show](https://battlebots.com/) on Discovery and HBO Max! We've fought bots built by other university teams and professional engineers from around the world, and won Rookie of the Year on our debut, in World Championship VI.
